# Mesh Network 🕸️

Experimental mesh networking project built in Rust, aiming to explore **decentralized, self-healing communication** between multiple nodes.  
The goal is to make it easy to experiment with mesh topologies, routing logic, and hardware-level communication without getting lost in boilerplate.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 🔩 **Hardware-aware design** – separated hardware configuration and wiring logic in `hardware_con/`
- 🧠 **Pluggable networking logic** – core networking concepts live in `src/`, making it easier to iterate on protocols and routing
- 🧪 **Experimental playground** – ideal for learning about mesh networks, Rust, and low-level communication
- 🚧 **Work in progress** – expect breaking changes, refactors, and lots of experimentation
